# Quiz_Game

With this homework assigment, I am tasked to create a quiz game. In my web development career, I will probably be asked to complete an assessment. This homework will give us practice in creating an assessment. This quiz game must be a multiple-choice assessment that is timed. The quiz must have dynamically created content with polished and responsive user interface.
